# UCSB
Hello, this is a compilation of some of the programming projects I have completed during my time at UCSB. Here is a description of each folder name (ordered by descending completed date):

Mathematical Finance (Fall 2022)
- This folder contains all programming portions of assignments for this course and a csv file AAPL.csv (you made need to scroll to the right) utilizing the black scholes model for constructing a delta neutral portfolio of AAPL stock's log returns.  
- This course describes mathematical methods for estimating and evaluating asset pricing models, equilibrium and derivative pricing, options, bonds, and the term-structure of interest rates. Also introduces finance optimization models for risk management and financial engineering.

Regression Analysis (Fall 2022)
- This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. These assignments demonstrate my data visualization, statistical programming, and data/statistical analysis skills in R. In Homework 6, you'll see my data visualization skills with ggplot2 which is a highly favored R package among data visualization frantics.
- Topics include linear and multiple regression, analysis of residuals, transformations, variable and model selection including stepwise regression, and analysis of covariance. This course stresses the use of computer packages to solve real-world problems.

Numerical Analysis A, B, & C (Winter 2022, Spring 2022 & Summer 2022)
- The topics I learned for this course were Numerical Differentiation and Integration, Initial-Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations, Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems, and Iterative Techniques in Matrix Algebra. The topics I learned in this course were Mathematical Preliminaries and Error Analysis, Solutions of Equations in One Variable, and Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation.
- This folder contains all the programming assignments I have completed. I used Jupyter Notebook to record and display my solutions in either Markdown/LaTeX or Python to each homework question. In each assignment, you'll see how I wrote short Python codes to efficiently derive strenuous numerical computations.

Applied Stochastic Processes A & B (Spring & Summer 2022)
- This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. I used Jupyter Notebook to program Python functions/computations relating to discrete and continous stochastic processes. The common Python libraries I used were numpy, matplotlib, math, and csv.
- Discrete probability models. Simulation techniques for random variables. Discrete time stochastic processes: random walks and Markov chains with applications to Monte Carlo simulation and mathematical finance. While there were not programming assignments for the second part of this course, we focused on continuous time stochastic processes: Poisson process, Markov chains, Renewal process, Brownian motion, including simulation of these processes. Applications to Black-Scholes model, insurance and ruin problems and related topics. 

SAS Base Programming (Winter 2022)
- This folder contains homework assignments I have completed for this course, using SAS Studio.
- In depth SAS programming course. Topics include importing/exporting raw data files, manipulating/transforming data, combining SAS data sets, generating reports, handling syntax and logic errors.
