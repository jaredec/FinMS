# UCSB
Hello, this is a compilation of some of the programming projects I have completed during my time at UCSB. Here is a description of each folder name (ordered by descending completed date):

Numerical Analysis (Winter 2022, Spring 2022, Summer 2022)
- The topics I learned for this course were Numerical Differentiation and Integration, Initial-Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations, Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems, and Iterative Techniques in Matrix Algebra. The topics I learned in this course were Mathematical Preliminaries and Error Analysis, Solutions of Equations in One Variable, and Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation.

- This folder contains all the programming assignments I have completed. I used Jupyter Notebook to record and display my solutions in either Markdown/LaTeX or Python to each homework question. In each assignment, you'll see how I wrote short Python codes to efficiently derive strenuous numerical computations.

Regression Analysis (Fall 2022)
- This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. These assignments demonstrate my data visualization, statistical programming, and data/statistical analysis skills in R. In Homework 6, you'll see my data visualization skills with ggplot2 which is a highly favored R package among data visualization frantics.
- Topics include linear and multiple regression, analysis of residuals, transformations, variable and model selection including stepwise regression, and analysis of covariance. This course stresses the use of computer packages to solve real-world problems.

Applied Stochastic Processes (Fall 2018)
- This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. I used Jupyter Notebook to program Python functions/computations relating to discrete and continous stochastic processes. The common Python libraries I used were numpy, matplotlib, math, and csv.
- The topics I learned in this course were Review of Probability Theory, Conditional Expectation, Moment Generating Functions, Tail Bounds & Limit Theorems, Random Walk, Markov Chains and Branching Process, Simulation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Poisson Process, and Application to Mathematical Finance.

SAS Base Programming
- This folder contains homework assignments I have completed for this course, using SAS Studio.
- In depth SAS programming course. Topics include importing/exporting raw data files, manipulating/transforming data, combining SAS data sets, generating reports, handling syntax and logic errors.

Mathematical Finance
- This folder contains all programming portions of assignments for this course and a csv file (AAPL) utilizing the black scholes model for constructing a delta neutral portfolio of AAPL stock's log returns.  
- This course describes mathematical methods for estimating and evaluating asset pricing models, equilibrium and derivative pricing, options, bonds, and the term-structure of interest rates. Also introduces finance optimization models for risk management and financial engineering.
