# UCSB
Hello, this is a compilation of some of the programming projects I have completed during my time at UCSB. Here is a description of each folder name (ordered by descending completed date):

Math 104A/B/C: Numerical Analysis (Winter 2022, Spring 2022, Summer 2022)

The topics I learned for this course were Numerical Differentiation and Integration, Initial-Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations, Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems, and Iterative Techniques in Matrix Algebra.

This folder contains all the programming assignments I have completed. I used Jupyter Notebook to record and display my solutions in either Markdown/LaTeX or Python to each homework question. In each assignment, you'll see how I wrote short Python codes to efficiently derive strenuous numerical computations.
The topics I learned in this course were Mathematical Preliminaries and Error Analysis, Solutions of Equations in One Variable, and Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation.

PSTAT 126: Regression Analysis (Fall 2022)

This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. These assignments demonstrate my data visualization, statistical programming, and data/statistical analysis skills in R. In Homework 6, you'll see my data visualization skills with ggplot2 which is a highly favored R package among data visualization frantics.
The topics I learned in this course were Linear and Multiple Regression, Analysis of Residuals, Variable and Model Selection including Stepwise Regression, and Analysis of Covariance.

PSTAT 160B: Applied Stochastic Process (Winter 2019)

This folder contains all the programming assignments I have completed for this course. I used Jupyter Notebook to record my analysis in Markdown and to program my solutions in Python. The common Python libraries I used to simulate continuous-time stochastic processes were numpy and matplotlib.
The topics I learned in this course were Poisson Process, Continuous-Time Markov Chains, Renewal Process, Brownian Motion (including simulations of these processes), and Application to Mathematical Finance.

PSTAT 160A: Applied Stochastic Processes (Fall 2018)

This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. I used Jupyter Notebook to program Python functions/computations relating to discrete and continous stochastic processes. The common Python libraries I used were numpy, matplotlib, math, and csv.
The topics I learned in this course were Review of Probability Theory, Conditional Expectation, Moment Generating Functions, Tail Bounds & Limit Theorems, Random Walk, Markov Chains and Branching Process, Simulation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Poisson Process, and Application to Mathematical Finance.
